<p>Currently, this customized Jekyll based website/blog is still a work in progress.  </p>

<p>This site/blog is going to eventually replace the <a href="http://www.2-Drops.com/blog-drop" title="AMMO's Blog Drop page">Blog Drop</a> page found on the <a href="http://www.2-Drops.com" title="Visit the 2 Drops website">2 Drops</a> website, and will make it easier for others to view and learn more about my coding experiences and interests.  </p>

<p>Until then, please feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ammocan" title="Connect with AMMO on LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
